# Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art model architecture for image classification tasks. 
# CNNs apply a series of filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, 
# which the model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:

# Convolutional layers, which apply a specified number of convolution filters to the image. For each subregion, 
# the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. 
# Convolutional layers then typically apply a ReLU activation function to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.


# Pooling layers, which downsample the image data extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map
# in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map 
# (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.

# Dense (fully connected) layers, which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers 
# and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.


# Typically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform feature extraction. Each module consists of a convolutional layer
# followed by a pooling layer. The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification.
# The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict),
# with a softmax activation function to generate a value between 0â€“1 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values is equal to 1).
# We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as relative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target class.
